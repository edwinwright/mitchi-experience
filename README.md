# Mitchi

Mitchi is a dice game for two or more players. You need two dice and a way to
keep score. This repository builds the site that publishes its rules, currently
in English, Spanish and Polish, with German and Japanese planned.

## Playing

Everything you need is on the site: how a round works, the ranking of hands,
worked examples, and the words players use at the table. No account, no
install, and no tracking beyond anonymous page counts.

## How it is built

A statically generated Next.js site on the App Router, with next-intl, Tailwind
and no UI kit. Every page is prerendered for every locale, with a request-time
proxy handling locale detection and rewrites.

The part worth reading is not the game, it is how the content is arranged so
that adding a language is a config change and a message file rather than an
audit of every page. German and Japanese are next, and are the real test of
that claim.

Source lives under `src`: routes in `src/app/[locale]`, components in
`src/components`, hand data in `src/data`, i18n configuration in `src/i18n`.
Copy lives in `messages/<locale>.json`, one file per language.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run i18n:check
./scripts/smoke.sh                 # production
./scripts/smoke.sh http://localhost:3000
```

`npm run build` must show `●` on every real route, for both locale paths, plus
a `proxy` entry. A route showing `ƒ`, other than `/[locale]/[...rest]`, means
something is reading request state at render time.

`npm run i18n:check` compares every locale against English for missing keys,
mismatched rich-text tags and mismatched ICU parameters. Untranslated strings
are committed as visible `[ES] ` / `[PL] ` markers, and production builds fail
on any marker, so an untranslated string cannot ship.

## Translations

Corrections are welcome, particularly from native speakers. The Polish is the
newest and has had only an initial check; see
`docs/domain/translation-rationale.pl.md` for what is still open.

Open an issue rather than a pull request for wording. Terminology is governed
by the glossary in `docs/domain`, so a change to one sentence usually means a
change there first, and it is worth agreeing the term before anyone edits five
files.

## Licence

Source-available, not open source. You can read the code, clone it and run it
locally, but you can't deploy it or republish its content elsewhere. Anything
you send, including translation suggestions, is covered by the contributions
terms in [LICENCE.md](LICENCE.md).
